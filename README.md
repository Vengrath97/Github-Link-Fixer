# Github Link Fixer
Hello this is a very simple app that is meant to change a link from standard github.com to raw.githubusercontent.com link.

## How does it work?
There are 2 text fields. And a button. To use it:

1. Copy the github.com/... link to your clipboard
2. Click the button "Fix this Github Link"
3. The app will fix your link.
   a) The original link will be displayed in top textbox.
   b) The fixed link will be displayed in bottom textbox.
   c) the fixed link will be copied to your clipboard.
